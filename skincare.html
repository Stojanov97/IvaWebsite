          Why is good skin care important? Good skin care is important for the
          following reasons: It helps your skin stay in good condition: You’re
          shedding skin cells throughout the day, so it’s important to keep your
          skin glowing and in good condition. An effective routine can help
          prevent acne, treat wrinkles, and help keep your skin looking its
          best. <br />
          Type of skin care textures : Serum Serums contain tiny molecules that
          penetrate deeper into the skin, making them lighter and more
          nourishing than moisturizers. It absorbs very quickly so you can put a
          moisturiser on top. It’s the perfect combination to repair deep skin
          while protecting the surface from damage. lotion Similar to a cream
          but lighter, the lotion is the perfect consistency if you like layered
          products. They get absorbed quickly and don’t stick to the skin or
          prevent other products from working. They also contain a small amount,
          if any, of oil, making them ideal for summer when the air is humid.
          cream Probably one of the most popular skincare textures, creams are
          thicker in consistency. This means they’re great for applying on top
          of your serums, concentrates and lotions. While they may not penetrate
          as deeply into the skin as described above, they form a barrier that
          helps prevent further moisture loss. Gel If your skin is prone to oily
          or blemishes, the gel texture is for you. The lightweight texture
          provides oil-free moisture, which is a treat during the hot months.
          Oil Perfect for very dry and sensitive skin, the oil has a rich, silky
          skincare texture that absorbs slowly into your skin, deeply hydrating
          and restoring your complexion’s moisture levels. I recommend using it
          as an overnight treatment to give it time to work its magic. Oh and
          don’t worry, contrary to popular belief, oils are not greasy. You just
          need to use them sparingly and massage them into the skin properly.
          Balms The balm is great for dry skin and has a very rich texture that
          is both super soothing and intensely moisturizing. It also helps
          prevent irritation. Mousse Like whipped cream, the mousse looks thick
          and smooth, but is surprisingly fluffy and fluffy. Often used for fake
          tans, this texture smoothes your skin like silk (similar to shaving
          cream, but lighter) and dries quickly for a professional-looking
          finish. Frosted With a few exceptions, most scrubs are formulated with
          tiny beads that give them a rather rough texture. Of course, it’s the
          beads that slough off dead skin cells and reveal fresh, smooth skin
          underneath. Miceral water Think of micellar water as a refreshing
          shower. It consists of tiny oil molecules suspended in water, wiping
          away impurities throughout the day in one fell swoop. Oh and it is
          great for sensitive skin. Foam Really light and breathable foams are
          great for oily skin as they absorb a lot of excess sebum. However,
          check the ingredient list for sulfates, as they can dry out your skin.
          You should choose a very mild one. Jelly When it comes to skincare
          texture, I love a good jelly. While feeling bouncy and bouncy, it
          still blends effortlessly into your skin, leaving no residue. It is
          usually a refreshing and cool application.
